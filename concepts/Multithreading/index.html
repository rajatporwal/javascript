    // Web Workers are Javascript scripts executed from an HTML page 
    // that runs on a background thread away from the main execution thread. 
    // Data is sent between the main thread and workers through messages. 
    // Since these workers run on a separate thread than the main execution thread, 
    // you can utilize web workers to run process intensive tasks from the browser without
    //  creating blocking instances.

    // Web worker has no access to:

        // window object
        // document object
        // parent object

    // Web worker has access to:

        // Navigator Obejct (useragent, geolocation, cookeyenabled)
